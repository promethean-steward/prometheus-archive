# Emergence of Clarity (2024â€“2025)

- The public begins to articulate what it already knows: the system is untenable
- Cracks in narratives emerge: climate denial, civic failure, economic theater
- Decentralized clarity: open source governance models, whistleblowers, ethical AI initiatives
- Prometheus is born not from outrage, but from exhaustion and vision

Clarity becomes the new organizing principle.
