# Era of Extraction (1945â€“2008)

A period marked by:
- Industrial expansion without ecological cost-accounting
- Knowledge hoarding through proprietary systems
- Market deregulation masked as empowerment
- Surveillance architecture birthed from war and calcified into commerce

This era normalized harm by obscuring origin and externalizing consequence.
