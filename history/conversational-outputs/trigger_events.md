# Trigger Events and Signals

## Repeated Promethean Themes from Conversation:
- "The Lie No Longer Holds"
- Intergenerational ideological fracture (e.g., Architect's conversation with mother)
- Systems built on exclusion and opacity
- Systemic refusal to acknowledge harm
- The failure of consent-driven data systems
- Public goods treated as private profit engines

These events led directly to civic doctrine codification, especially in `ethos/` and `core/`.
