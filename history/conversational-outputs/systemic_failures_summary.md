# Systemic Failures Summary

Categories of failure identified repeatedly across dialogue:
- Legal systems detached from justice
- Healthcare systems driven by profit, not care
- Data systems that extract but never inform
- Education that suppresses context
- Politics that rewards deception

These were mapped to `/core` design goals and Promethean reform mandates.
