# 🧬 Prometheus Core Synthesis

> *The future is built when alignment meets action.*

This synthesis document merges the foundational principles, doctrines, and engineering intents laid out in the `/core` layer of Prometheus. It is not a summary. It is a cross-section — where ethics, architecture, accountability, and purpose converge.

---

## 🔗 I. Foundational Doctrines

Prometheus is scaffolded by interlocking civic and systemic doctrines. Together, they form the **First Principles Contract**:

- **Civic Accountability** — Failure is not hidden. Repair is public. Signed work is sacred.
- **Final Form** — Systems are iterated toward irreducibility. All complexity must justify itself.
- **Energy-Aware Engineering** — Wattage is moral. Every cycle is a choice. Waste is theft.
- **Right to Repair** — Knowledge is not hoarded. Modifiability is a civic right.
- **Open by Default** — Lock-in is treason to the public trust.
- **Civic Knowledge** — Tribal knowledge is deprecated. Operations must teach.

These doctrines are not modular. They are indivisible.

---

## 🧭 II. Behavioral Compass

All participants in Prometheus — human or system — operate under a shared behavioral compass:

- Speak plainly
- Sign everything
- Fail loud
- Fix fast
- Measure ethically
- Design like the future depends on it
- Teach while doing

This is culture, not suggestion. And it must be enforced not by code or coercion, but by shared belief in better systems.

## 🔐 III. Trust as a Stack

Prometheus treats trust as a layered architecture:

1. **Identity** – Users are sovereign. All access begins with user-owned keys.
2. **Consent** – All data movement is authorized, documented, and revocable.
3. **Audit** – Every system action is cryptographically logged and signed.
4. **Insight** – Users have visibility into where their data lives and how it's used.
5. **Correction** – Errors are correctable and reversions are built-in.

This stack governs both technical and human interfaces.

## 🏗️ IV. Systems Expectations

Promethean systems must:

- Be deterministic, recoverable, and resilient
- Be upgradeable without downtime or coercion
- Be able to segment, hot-swap, and verify modules
- Default to transparency in logs, logic, and lineage
- Support versioning and rollbacks across every domain

"Finished" does not mean unchangeable. It means ready for consequence.

---

## 🧪 V. Experimental Ethos

Prometheus is not afraid to fail. But it refuses to hide failure.

- Experiments are encouraged — but must be documented.
- Simulations and sandboxes are preferred over production risks.
- All experiments must be reversible and attributable.

Build bravely. But be ready to roll back.

---

## 🤝 VI. Governance Requirements

Every system governed by `/core` must:

- Publish a changelog with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Maintain a civic audit ledger
- Provide accessible summaries of technical decisions
- Accept retrospectives and community feedback
- Allow human override paths when ethics are at stake

Governance is not paperwork. It is prevention, restoration, and humility.

## 📌 VII. Meta-Reflection

This document is **self-amending** — governed by its own changelog, subject to future synthesis as new doctrines emerge.

It stands not as an endpoint but as a synchronized state of belief, verified in May 2025 by the stewarding Architect.
