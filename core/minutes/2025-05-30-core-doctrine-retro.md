**Date:** 2025-05-30  
**Location:** Prometheus Archive Virtual Workspace  
**Chair/Scribe:** Architect (Jeffrey Jones)

## 🧭 Meeting Purpose

To ratify tone, scope, and delivery of the `Civic Accountability Doctrine` and explore accompanying infrastructure for archive change management.

---

## 🗒️ Agenda

1. Finalize tone: no profanity, no condescension, maximum clarity  
2. Introduce `/core/minutes/` as permanent civic record  
3. Add rolling changelog via Conventional Commits  
4. Design intent for archive strategy using Git/IPFS stack

---

## 🧠 Notes

- All doctrines must survive pearl-clutching readers and reach pragmatic builders  
- Conventional Commits accepted as canonical commit format  
- All changelogs will be auto-generated from commit history  
- No reinvention of archive systems unless materially necessary  
- `/core/minutes/` will preserve civic debates, retrospectives, and strategic direction shifts with human attribution

---

## ✅ Outcomes

- `civic_accountability.md` finalized and linked to core  
- Draft structure for `core_manifest.md` and `core_synthesis.md` accepted  
- Addendum language for Conventional Commits and `/minutes/` inserted  
- Archive regeneration to follow with every ratified file change
