# 🧭 Prometheus Core

Welcome to the `/core` directory of Project Prometheus — the foundational civic, ethical, and engineering layer that governs all higher system function.

## 📂 Purpose

This directory contains the canonical doctrines and documents that define:

- Ethical constraints

All files are written to be self-contained, signed, and publicly auditable.

- `core_manifest.md`: Source of record for all file updates and domain coverage
- `core_synthesis.md`: Unified narrative and implementation philosophy
- `minutes/`: Time-stamped human meeting logs and refinements
