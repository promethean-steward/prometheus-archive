# ðŸ§  Civic Design

Prometheus is designed for humans first â€” and that includes the language it uses, the assumptions it makes, and the questions it refuses to ignore. Interfaces must:

- Speak plainly, like a sixth grader
- Explain all decisions and affordances
- Enable correction and learning

Beauty matters. Empathy matters. Confusion is a bug, not a user failure.
