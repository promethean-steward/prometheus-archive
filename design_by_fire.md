# ðŸ”¥ Design by Fire

No Promethean system is speculative. It must earn its place through live use, human scrutiny, and failure. We do not:

- Rely on lab-only assumptions
- Accept systems that are untested in stress scenarios
- Allow silence when systems degrade

Every feature is fire-tested. Every policy is lived experience.
