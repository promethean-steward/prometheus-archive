**Date:** 2025-06-01  
**Location:** Prometheus Archive Virtual Workspace  
**Facilitator:** Architect (Jeffrey Jones)

## Purpose

Define tone, boundaries, and non-negotiable traits for civic and cultural interfaces in Prometheus.

## Key Notes

- Design must be explainable to a sixth grader
- Complexity is permitted only when necessary ‚Äî must be justifiable
- Opt-outs, transparency, empathy-first errors are required
- No sarcasm, no manipulation, no emotional coercion in UX

## Outcomes

- `civic_design.md`, `freedom_stack.md`, and `design_by_fire.md` authored and signed
- Ethos is now enforceable via civic audit and narrative tone reviews
