# Collapse of Trust (2008â€“2024)

- 2008 Financial Crisis reveals systemic fraud and public disposability
- Social media accelerates consensus decay
- Public health becomes politicized
- Institutions refuse to own consequences or communicate plainly
- The concept of 'truth' becomes partisan

This sets the stage for Promethean intervention.
