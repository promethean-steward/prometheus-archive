# Index: Promethean Historical Narrative

This directory contains narrative reconstructions of systemic breakdowns and civic insights, framed chronologically. Unlike the conversational outputs, these documents aim to **tell the story** — giving context, continuity, and consequence to the Promethean initiative.

**Documents Included:**
- `era_of_extraction.md`
- `collapse_of_trust.md`
- `emergence_of_clarity.md`
- `roots_of_resilience.md`
- `timeline_major_events.md`

Each is a modular piece of a living civic history — draftable, discussable, and expandable.
