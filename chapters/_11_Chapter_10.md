**Chapter 10: Inheritance vs. Legacy**

We have been taught to confuse inheritance with legacy.

Inheritance is transactional. It is the transfer of resources, power, or privilege—often hoarded, seldom earned. It is the reward of proximity, not merit. And more often than not, it sustains systems that were designed to protect the few.

Legacy is different. Legacy is contribution. It is the echo of action, not the residue of ownership. Legacy is not what you keep—it’s what you leave.

Prometheus draws this distinction with precision. Inheritance asks who benefits. Legacy asks what endures.

This chapter unpacks the inherited structures of governance, economy, and culture. It illustrates how dynastic thinking—whether in politics, business, or ideology—undermines adaptation. It explores the consequences of mistaking possession for purpose.

Promethean systems center legacy. Not as myth, but as accountability. What you build must serve beyond your lifespan. What you do must ripple with integrity. What you stand for must withstand time.

Inheritance can be revoked.

But legacy must be earned.
