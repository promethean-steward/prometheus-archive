**Chapter 8: The Myth of Neutrality**

There is no such thing as a neutral system.

Every algorithm, every law, every policy reflects the assumptions, interests, and biases of its creators. Neutrality, as it is commonly invoked, is not the absence of perspective—it is the concealment of one.

Prometheus begins with the admission that no action is without context. No structure is free of legacy. The systems that claim impartiality most vocally are often those with the most to hide. Whether in technology, economics, or governance, the myth of neutrality has been a tool of obfuscation, shielding power from scrutiny.

This chapter dissects the architecture of that myth. It shows how neutrality is deployed to maintain status quos, to sanitize inequity, to preempt reform. It investigates case studies across disciplines—predictive policing, financial regulation, media framing—and surfaces the hidden fingerprints of human agenda.

Promethean systems do not aspire to be neutral. They aspire to be honest.

They do not hide their values. They encode them transparently. They are accountable not because they are perfect, but because they are willing to be interrogated.

In Prometheus, design is declaration.

And every declaration must be justifiable.
