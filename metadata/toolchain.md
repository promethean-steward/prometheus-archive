# Toolchain and Provenance Notes

This archive was generated through a structured process involving:

- Conversational synthesis between human steward ("Architect") and AI assistant ("Root")
- Markdown rendering and recursive hydration of ideas, principles, documents, and manifest files
- Validation against Promethean standards for completeness, ethical consistency, and traceability

## Components

- Archive tooling: Internal OpenAI code execution environment
- Naming conventions: CamelCase and kebab-case per domain semantics
- Changelog style: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Content licensing: [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

## Export Targets

- IPFS
- Git repositories (manual onboarding)
- PDF and ePub (for select publications)

This document should be updated any time the build process, export path, or synthesis model changes.
