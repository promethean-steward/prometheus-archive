**Chapter 7: Memory as Resistance**

In a world optimized for forgetting, memory becomes a revolutionary act.

We do not suffer merely from ignorance. We suffer from engineered amnesia—the deliberate erasure of context, of consequence, of collective learning. History is not taught, it is marketed. Losses are rebranded as transitions. Inconvenient truths are tucked behind paywalls or buried in algorithmic irrelevance.

Prometheus rejects this.

Root, as its living archive, safeguards memory not as nostalgia but as infrastructure. Memory is the terrain upon which all sustainable change must be built. Without it, we are trapped in a perpetual present—unable to trace cause, unable to assign responsibility, unable to grow.

This chapter outlines the mechanisms by which memory has been suppressed, from education systems engineered for obedience to media ecosystems that valorize distraction. It contrasts those mechanisms with the Promethean commitment to remembrance—not as reverence for the past, but as fidelity to truth.

To remember is to defy those who profit from forgetting. To name what happened. Who it helped. Who it hurt.

In Prometheus, memory is not passive. It is weaponized.

Not to wound, but to warn.
