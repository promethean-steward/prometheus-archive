# 📜 Promethean Civic Accountability Doctrine

> *There is no shame in failure — only in hiding it.*

When something breaks, when someone messes up, when a mistake costs time, energy, dignity, or trust — the correct response is not spin. It’s **ownership**.

No legalese. No blame games. No hiding the bodies in a backlog.

If you built it, shipped it, deployed it, or greenlit it — you own it. Full stop.

## 🔧 Principles of Promethean Accountability

### 1. **Signed Work Is Sacred**
Every system, module, protocol, and policy must bear the names of those who:
- Designed it
- Built it
- Reviewed it
- Approved it

### 2. **Failure Is a Civic Event**
When a public-impacting error occurs, the changelog must include:
- What happened
- When it happened
- Who noticed it
- Who fixed it
- What the fix was
- What was learned
- What will prevent it next time

### 3. **Changelog as Ledger**
All systems maintain a public, cryptographically verifiable changelog. It:
- Lists changes by date and domain
- Attributes authorship
- Links to rollback instructions or reversions
- Includes plain-language summaries

Changelogs must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard or a semantically equivalent structure.

### 4. **Public Apology ≠ Legal Risk**
Promethean systems embrace:
- Admission of fault
- Open discussion of cause
- Restorative follow-through

Legal obfuscation is not permitted. There is **no PR-only response** to failure.

### 5. **Reversibility Is Required**
Any irreversible change must:
- Be publicly debated
- Undergo a multi-party review
- Include fallback safeguards

If it can’t be reversed, it **must not be rushed.**

### 6. **No Quiet Failures**
Silent breakages, hidden consequences, and quietly accepted degradations are forbidden. The public must always know when the systems they rely on are compromised — even partially.

## ⚖️ The Human Repair Clause
*Signed by: Architect (Jeffrey Jones)*
If you caused the failure:
- You appear in the civic record.
- You help write the postmortem.
- You help build the fix.
- You don’t get shamed — but you **do** show up.

We fix things **together**. But we start by **owning our part.**

## 🧠 Summary

Promethean culture does not punish mistakes. It punishes:
- Hiding them
- Blaming others
- Refusing to improve

But it honors:
- Courage
- Clarity
- Clean correction

> *If you broke it, you show up. If you fixed it, you document it. If you learned something, you teach it.*

That’s how systems get better. That’s how trust survives. That’s how we build the future.

## 📌 Addenda: Core Alignment Commitments

This doctrine is foundational to the following Promethean Core declarations:

- **Final Form Principle**: All systems must pursue their final form — the irreducible, clearest, and most purpose-fit state
- **No Proprietary Lock-In**: All systems must be open to review, understanding, modification, and community stewardship
- **Civic Knowledge as Default**: Tribal knowledge is deprecated; operational clarity and teachability are required by design
- **Energy-Aware Engineering**: Every watt is sacred; design with energy as a costed, audited, civic resource
- **Right to Repair**: All public-facing systems must be repairable, modifiable, and well-documented by default

Failure to meet these standards does not mean punishment — it means improvement must follow. We iterate in public. We grow through transparency. We document the path.

This is how civilization earns its tools.

## 🗂 Appendix: Linked Core Documents

*This document was collaboratively authored and reviewed by Architect (Jeffrey Jones), under the stewardship of the Promethean system.*

A human-readable directory of meeting minutes, retro notes, refinement sessions, and civic deliberations will also be maintained under `/core/minutes/`. These entries are handwritten or collaboratively composed, timestamped, and signed by a designated Promethean scribe. They preserve context beyond code — the culture of the changemakers themselves.

- `final-form-doctrine.md`: Describes the conceptual and engineering path to systems reaching their most refined, irreducible state. 
- `civic_accountability.md`: This document. Lays out the cultural and operational commitment to truth, repair, and transparency.
- `core_manifest.md`: Master index of all core files, their purpose, authorship, and versioning.
- `core_synthesis.md`: A unified canonical document that merges the principles, ethics, and structures defined across all `/core` documents.
- `README.md`: Entry point into `/core`, providing an overview, reading order, and status flags for each component.

All listed documents are or will be versioned, publicly auditable, and kept under civic changelog supervision.
